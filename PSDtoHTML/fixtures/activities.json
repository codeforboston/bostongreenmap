Stretching three miles along the river, the Esplanade provides for a diversity of recreation including biking, boating, and playing ball. The Hatch Memorial Shell is located here, which attracts hundreds of thousands of people to special events including the Boston Pops July 4th concert. Water quality in the Basin has improved dramatically in recent years, creating better habitat for wildlife and attracting people back to the river.\r\n",

These include tennis and basketball courts, baseball fields, the region’s premier cross country track, and an 18-hole golf course. A 72-acre zoo is also part of what the park has to offer, along with miles of some of the best walking trails in the city, including a 2.5 mile paved loop around the golf course for pedestrians and bicyclists. Franklin Park's huge Roxbury Puddingstone boulders and cliffs and old stone ruins offer unique scenic landscape for park walkers. Built in the 1880s and located in the geographic heart of Boston, Franklin Park today carries on the tradition of a park for people from all walks of life and all backgrounds. ",

A water play area, plenty of picnic tables and shaded seating as well as a fascinating outdoor museum that serves up city facts and history on colorful, giant lollipop-shaped signs round out the fun. You'd never know the beautiful 4.5-acre site was a former brownfield that the city reclaimed after a smelting company spent 50 years polluting it.\r\n\r\nOther highlights include a park house with bathrooms, a state-run DCR indoor skating rink in the center of the property, and a free parking lot (on Bleachery Court). And no resident should miss out on the fun facts on the storytelling path.
